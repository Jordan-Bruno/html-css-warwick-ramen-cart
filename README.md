# html-css-warwick-ramen-cart
 This project is a simple static website for a fictional ramen food cart located at the University of Warwick. It features a modern and mobile-responsive menu layout with styled cards for ramen, drinks, and desserts. The design uses clean HTML and CSS, along with the Google Font "Zen Maru Gothic" to give it a subtle Japanese aesthetic.
